Title: Experiment #001

==================================

Goal of today's experiment is to set up a development environment.
There will be 3 requirements for this setup:

- Main programming language will be plain C89.
- Using standard build tool `make` only.
- Separating project structure as follows:
  - `lib/`: A barebones no-std environment. Produces a single static library.
  - `tests/`: A list of C files, each named after its experiment number. e.g. as `tests/experiment-001.c`. Produces an executable binary file per experiment.

Besides these requirements, there will be these QoL features for this project:

- Running `make` without any targets should default to building, and running each test.
- Running `make lib` should build the static library.
- Running `make fmt` should format each `.c` and `.h` file according to BSD style guidelines.

Results:
========

Experiment was done in 3 stages. First, bootstrapping
the empty directory with a simple static library, followed
by setting up a testing suite and a simple formatting
capability to finish it up.

Initially the LLM was instructed to summarize this experiment entry. It has done fantastically well:

Based on the README.md, I understand this is an experimental project with specific development environment requirements. Let me break down the key points:

1. Project Structure:
   - The project will be written in C89 (ANSI C)
   - Two main directories:
     - `lib/`: Contains a no-std environment that compiles into a static library
     - `tests/`: Contains test files named as `experiment-XXX.c` where XXX is the experiment number

2. Build System:
   - Uses `make` as the only build tool
   - Three main make targets:
     - Default target (`make`): Builds everything and runs all tests
     - `make lib`: Builds just the static library
     - `make fmt`: Formats all C source and header files using BSD style

3. Technical Constraints:
   - Using C89 standard, which means:
     - No C99/C11/C17 features
     - Variable declarations must be at the start of blocks
     - No inline functions
     - No // comments (only /* */ style)
   - No standard library in the `lib/` component (no-std environment)
   - BSD style formatting for code

This appears to be a minimalist, well-structured experimental environment where each experiment can be isolated in its own test file while sharing common functionality through the static library.

Would you like me to help you set up this development environment or focus on any specific aspect of this structure?

The LLM has done as follows @stage:

- Static Library: First try seem to have worked. If instructed granularly it appears to produce code that works reliably without much effort.

- Test Suite: Done better than expected. But this stage also instructed clearly the steps to be taken. Code was reliable. Slight hiccups and inconsiderate design decisions around the build system were fixed by correction after 2 iterations.

- Formatting: LLM was instructed to use MacOS builtin command `indent` for formatting. It initially produced code compatible with GNU indent instead. After reporting errors regarding missing or otherwise incorrect arguments used, it didn't appear to have understood the difference between these tools. Heavy human aid resulted in LLM producing a desirable solution, however it took approximately 10 iterations of correction. Not ideal.
