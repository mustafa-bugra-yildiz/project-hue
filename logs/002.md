==================================

Goal of today's experiment is to set up a basic parsing facility.
Given a string, it should parse:

- Integers: A sequence of bytes, all made up by digits in base 10.
- Floats:  Integers with a floating-point precision, separated by a dot (.).
- Strings: A sequence of bytes, delimited by double quotes (").

Following test cases are to be implemented:

- POSITIVE: Parsing a well-formed integer should not error.
- POSITIVE: Parsing a well-formed float should not error.
- POSITIVE: Parsing a well-formed string should not error.

- NEGATIVE: Parsing a float with either a missing integer or decimal part, such as "3." or ".14" should error.
- NEGATIVE: Parsing an unterminated string should error.

Additionally, the parser cannot do any dynamic memory allocation due
to the lib being a no-std environment.

Results:
========

The LLM was instructed to generate the test cases
in the test suite. The code generated, although
missing the implementations of functions, was adequate.

Next step was instructing the LLM to generate the
parser code. It generated code that only concerned
with consuming the input until the end but the code
was indeed not allocating memory dynamically.
However, the function names generated in the parser
code was different then what it generated in the 
test suite. LLM did not reason to update them.
This issue was fixed easily after correction.

The LLM was then instructed to run the test suite.
All tests passed on first try. Exquisite.
